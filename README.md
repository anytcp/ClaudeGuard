# 🛡️ ClaudeGuard

**A VPN-whitelist guard for Claude on macOS.**

Blocks the **Claude Desktop** app, the **Claude Code CLI** (`claude`) and every Claude/Anthropic domain (`claude.ai`, `claude.com`, `anthropic.com` and all their subdomains) whenever your public IP is not on your VPN whitelist - so you never touch Claude from the wrong region by accident.

## Why

If your account is region-sensitive, a single request from the wrong IP can get your account flagged.
ClaudeGuard solves that: every launch and every running session is checked against your whitelist of allowed IPs, and access is cut the instant you fall off it.

## Features

- 🔐 **IP whitelist** - Claude opens **only** when your public IP matches one of your VPN nodes.
- ⏱ **Instant pre-flight check** - launching `claude` or `Claude.app` verifies the public IP in < 0.5s (STUN over UDP). Not whitelisted → blocked before anything connects.
- 🧠 **One brain, one verdict** - a background daemon publishes the decision to a state file; the CLI, the app launcher and the menu bar all read the same verdict, so nothing can disagree.
- 🚀 **Autostart at login** via `LaunchAgent`.
- 🟢 **Menu bar UI** - live status (🟢 protected / 🔴 blocked / ⚪ offline / 🟡 off), toggles, one-click whitelist.
- ❄️ **Freeze auto-updates** - blocks Claude's update servers and locks the update dirs.

## Install

The installer compiles the native binaries (Swift + C) **on your machine**. Locally-compiled binaries
carry no quarantine flag, so **Gatekeeper never blocks them** - no Apple Developer account, no code-signing,
no notarization, no Homebrew. The only requirement is Xcode Command Line Tools (the installer offers to
install them if missing).

Two ways to install - both give the exact same result.

**Option 1 - one line** (downloads and builds from GitHub):

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivblz/ClaudeGuard/main/install.sh)"
```

**Option 2 - from a local copy** (a cloned or downloaded repo; never touches GitHub):

```bash
./install.sh
```

Either way it compiles for your architecture (Apple Silicon or Intel), installs the menu bar daemon at login,
and wraps the `claude` command. It asks for your password once (`sudo` is needed to edit `/etc/hosts` and pf)
and offers to whitelist your current IP - accept **only if you are on your VPN right now.**

**Uninstall:**

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## CLI

After install the `claudeguard` command is available:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claudeguard status` | Current status, IP and whitelist |
| `claudeguard add-ip <ip>` | Add an IP or CIDR to the whitelist |
| `claudeguard remove-ip <ip>` | Remove an IP from the whitelist |
| `claudeguard list-ips` | List whitelisted IPs |
| `claudeguard enable-protection` / `disable-protection` | Turn protection on / off |
| `claudeguard block-updates` / `allow-updates` | Lock / unlock auto-updates |
| `claudeguard launch-desktop` | Launch Claude Desktop with a pre-flight check |
| `claudeguard start` / `stop` | Start / stop the menu bar daemon |
| `claudeguard doctor` | Check every hook is still attached, and re-attach it |
| `claudeguard set-cli-path <path>` | Point at the real `claude` binary if auto-detect misses it |

### Surviving Claude reinstalls

Reinstalling Claude Code puts the real `claude` binary back over ClaudeGuard's shim,
and updating it deletes the version-stamped path the shim hands off to - so the guard
would silently detach while the menu bar still showed 🟢. The same applies to Claude
Desktop, whose bundle id and update directories have been renamed before.

ClaudeGuard therefore discovers those locations instead of hard-coding them, and
re-attaches whatever came loose: the daemon self-heals **every 60s**, the `claude`
wrapper re-hooks on each run, and `/etc/hosts` is re-applied whenever something
external edits it. Run `claudeguard doctor` to see the state of every hook (and fix
it immediately) at any time.

## How it works

1. **STUN-first IP detection** - the public IP is resolved via a single UDP STUN round-trip (tens of ms), falling back to HTTP echo services on networks that block UDP.
2. **The brain** (`src/brain.py`) turns that IP into one verdict - `allowed` / `blocked` / `offline` - and it **fails closed**: only a confirmed `allowed` lets Claude run.
3. **Single source of truth** - the menu bar daemon writes its verdict to `~/.config/claudeguard/state.json` on every check. The CLI wrapper and app launcher read it (instant), and fall back to their own check only if the daemon is down.
4. **Enforcement** - the whole Claude/Anthropic domain family (~175 hosts across 5 apex domains) is blocked via `/etc/hosts` + a pf firewall rule (TCP + UDP/QUIC); the desktop app is force-quit with an alert; a running `claude` session is killed the moment the IP leaves the whitelist.

> **Scope:** this is accidental-leak protection for your own machine, not a defense against a malicious admin. The truly unbypassable layer (a Network Extension content filter) requires a paid Apple Developer account; the on-device approach here is the free ceiling and covers accidental leaks well.
