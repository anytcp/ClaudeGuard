"""
The brain: the one place that decides "may Claude run right now".

Verdict: "allowed" (protection off, or IP whitelisted) / "blocked" (online, IP
not whitelisted) / "offline" (IP can't be verified). Fail closed — only a
confirmed "allowed" gets through.

The source of truth is the daemon (main.swift), which publishes its verdict to
state.json on every check. Every consumer (the claude wrapper, the launcher, the
CLI) reads that same file, so the components can never disagree. If the daemon is
down (file missing or stale) the brain runs its own STUN-first check, so
protection never drops out silently.
